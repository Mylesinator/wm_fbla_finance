    </div>
    <h2>The idea for our program was born from the challenges faced by students trying to juggle academics and personal finances. Many of us experienced the struggle of managing limited budgets while balancing part-time jobs and school. This inspired us to create a solution that simplifies financial management and provides valuable insights into spending patterns.</h2>
